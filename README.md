# Docs - Web-Native.Dev

This is the documentation for "web-native" libraries and frameworks.

## Welcome to the Web-Native Project!

The Web-Native Project introduces new ways to solve frontend engineering problems using native language features. This approach will save us of all new markup languages, weird syntaxes and their compile steps and build tools. If you miss how vanilla coding made us feel and the easy "pick-up" and universality of libraries like jQuery, you will be delighted again!

Here are some exciting Web-Native tools that will help you get the most of web-native development:

> [CHTML](chtml/) - _Implement UI components in plain HTML_
>
> [Reflex](reflex/) - _Apply reactivity to any JavaScript object_
>
> [JSEN](jsen/) - _Run JavaScript expressions in user-defined scopes_

Everything in this technology stack is an independent library that can be used alone or together in high cohesion for a better Developer Experience and a happier app.
