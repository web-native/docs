# Docs - Web-Native.Dev

Welcome to the documentation for "web-native" tools!

## Overview

Through engineering, the Web-Native Project aims to bridge major gaps on the web platform to meet modern development needs. A more empowering platform will be helping us get more done with less dependencies!

Here are some exciting Web-Native tools that will help you get the most of web-native development:

> [CHTML](chtml/) - _Implement the UI entirely in HTML_
>
> [Reflex](reflex/) - _Apply reactivity to any JavaScript object_
>
> [JSEN](jsen/) - _Run JavaScript expressions in user-defined scopes_
>
> [Play UI](play-ui/) - _Manipulate the DOM and the UI with more resilience_
>
> [Observables](reflex-components/) - _Components for your reflex-based apps_

Everything in this technology stack is an independent library that can be used alone or together in high cohesion for a better Developer Experience and a happier app.
