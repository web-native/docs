# CHTML

CHTML is a suite of short specifications and technologies that **bring a component architecture to the HTML language itself**. This lets us create the UI and its components entirely in HTML - a new **pure-HTML** approach that requires no build tools, or compilers, or even a template syntax!

[Check this project out on GitHub](https://github.com/web-native/chtml).

## Getting Started

[Start here](specs/) for a brief overview of CHTML and follow each topic to learn more. You may also dive straight into a subject:

* [Scoped HTML](specs/scoped-html.md)
* [Scoped CSS](specs/scoped-css.md)
* [Scoped JS](specs/scoped-js.md)
* [HTML Transport](specs/html-transport/) 

Next, follow the [installation guide](chtml-guide/installation.md) to add CHTML to your page.

## Guides

* [Installation Guide](chtml-guide/installation.md)
* [Server-Side Rendering](chtml-guide/server-side-rendering.md)

## Issues?

We're sure there will be errors around here - typos on our docs, clever bugs in code. Feel free to bring these to our notice by filing a GitHub issue.

It's also important to note that CHTML is a bleeding edge technology and may change quickly. Please do thread safely! But as much as we know today, stability is just a few iterations away.
