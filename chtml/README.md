# CHTML
<<<<<<< HEAD
CHTML is a suite of short specifications and technologies that **bring a component architecture to the HTML language itself**. This lets us create the UI and its components entirely in HTML - a new **pure-HTML** approach that requires no build tools, or compilers, or even a template syntax!

[Check this project out on GitHub](https://github.com/web-native/chtml).

## Getting Started
[Here is a brief overview](/chtml/v060/specs/) of CHTML that gives you a vertical takeoff! You may also dive straight into a topic:
+ [Scoped HTML](/chtml/v060/specs/scoped-html/README.md)
+ [Scoped CSS](/chtml/v060/specs/scoped-css/README.md)
+ [Scoped JS](/chtml/v060/specs/scoped-js/README.md)
+ [HTML Transport](/chtml/v060/specs/html-transport/README.md)

You should next [include CHTML on your page](/chtml/v060/guide/installation.md) and bring the excitement home.
