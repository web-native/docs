# CHTML
CHTML is a suite of short specifications and technologies that **bring a component architecture to the HTML language itself**. This lets us create the UI and its components entirely in HTML - a new **pure-HTML** approach that requires no build tools, or compilers, or even a template syntax!

[Check this project out on GitHub](https://github.com/web-native/chtml).

## Getting Started
[Start here](/chtml/v060/specs/) for a brief overview of CHTML, then follow each topic to learn more. You may also dive straight into a subject:
+ [Scoped HTML](/chtml/v060/specs/scoped-html/README.md)
+ [Scoped CSS](/chtml/v060/specs/scoped-css/README.md)
+ [Scoped JS](/chtml/v060/specs/scoped-js/README.md)
+ [HTML Transport](/chtml/v060/specs/html-transport/README.md) 

Next, follow the [installation guide](/chtml/v060/guide/installation.md) to add CHTML to your page.

+ [Server-Side Rendering](/chtml/v060/guide/server-side-rendering.md)

## Issues
We're sure there will be errors around here - typos on our docs, clever bugs in code. Feel free to bring these to our notice by filing a GitHub issue. 

It's also important to note that CHTML is a bleeding edge technology and may change quickly. Please do thread safely! But as much as we know today, stability is just a few iterations away.
