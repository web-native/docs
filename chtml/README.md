# CHTML

CHTML is a pure HTML-based, **UI functional design system** that lets you build your UI from smaller html components and have everything work as one wonderful piece of craftsmanship. This is a fundamental shift that finally brings UI development from the **engineering** realm of JavaScript back to the **design** field of HTML \(the original markup language for the web\)!

Build elegant user interfaces without learning a template syntax or a build tool! Share your html-based components around and use them anywhere HTML works and forget about a compile step or a dependency! This is the luxury of an HTML-based design system! CHTML **empowers the design side of you** and enriches your overall design experience by _minimizing your engagement with JavaScript_ on the UI; all that engineering should really be the concern of the application layer.

This project is opensource and [hosted on Github](https://github.com/web-native/chtml).

Take the [Getting Started Guide](guide/) or continue here for an introduction to CHTML.

## Why CHTML

We simply discovered that the sanest way to approach the UI is to take aside the _rigid framework_ and embrace a _design system_! If you're new to the idea of design systems, you will be intrigued at how much order they bring to your design and development process.

### Rich Design Experience

Today's prevailing frameworks have overwhelmed our most-exciting realm of design - the UI - with full application engineering; think the data-fetching logic, routing, and the business logic lurking deep in UI elements. Design has never been this altered! **If you're currently engineering all the way, say** _**Hi**_ **to a design system!**

With CHTML you can regain focus on just the things that matter in the UI: structure, aesthetics, and behaviour. **You should really be working in an overall design experience that's void of the influence a framework exerts!**

* **Play Away**: With components now living as plain HTML files, think how much now gets out of the way! No compiling from language A to language B; no build step; no complex tooling; no overkill.

### The Flexibility of a Design System!

There's much to be said about **the trap of coupling the UI with a full-fledged application framework** \(a la React, Angular, Ember, et al\). For one thing, you have a technology dependency that inherently limits where that UI can go.

With CHTML, you have a **specifications-driven system that's totally implementation-agnostic**! You approach your implementation with a wider variety of technologies, your own design principles \(think style guides, best practices, etc\), and project-specific requirements, and at the end, come off with consistent results! CHTML is how everything - whatever it is - fits together!

* **Evolve Quickly**: Change, growth, and the rest of tomorrow's unknown are the most certain things we know of! How do you want to face the challenge? With a rigid foundation or a flexible one? .

### The Web-Native Advantage!

Tooling is essential to a design system if we must obtain something usable from the specifications - think all the browser-based technologies that translate our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript blueprints into an amazing UI. **But the more generic the design and tooling, the more universal the system gets.** The is the good news with CHTML!

Much like the web platform itself, CHTML has been intentionally designed as a generic foundation on which anyone can build, and thus **sets its limits on vanilla HTML, JavaScript and CSS for structure, behaviour, and presentation respectively**! This makes it easy to leverage platform features and APIs and gives you a zero-abstraction layer from which to take your application to any level of engineering.

* **Meet the Future**: Underpinned on tags and attributes, CHTML helps you secure a future-proof approach to your UI! There can't be a better bet on stability and relevance than a native foundation!
