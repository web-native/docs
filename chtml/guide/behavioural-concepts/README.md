# Behavioural Concepts

Having seen how to create component instances, we're now ready to put them to work. We are going to have the flexibility of being able to drive UI behaviours either programmatically - by manipulating the component tree at the application level - or declaratively - by applying directives at markup level.

The first section below covers traversing and manipulating the component tree from within the application, and, ultimately, binding the UI to the state of the application. With this background knowledge, we will next see how directives help us acheive the same thing more declaratively.
